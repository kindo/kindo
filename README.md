Hello, Welcome to my github, Iâ€™m Freddy HOUNDEKINDO.

ðŸ‘€ I am a young graduate in water science with a keen interest in climate risk management. 
I'm interested in statistics, geostatistics, machine learning for flood forcasting and hydraulic modeling.  

ðŸ“« Always feel welcome to get in touch with me through my email: freddykindo@gmail.com. I would very much enjoy sharing and learning from you.
